    "Susan" "Someone does it sincerely, someone uses this method to achieve specific goals."

    "Susan" "But none of them ever feels or will ever feel like they really are."

translate eng christie_root_5_after_menu_9db0eaa2:





    "Susan" "But first and foremost it's self-love. You don't wake up in cold sweat, you're not ashamed of your tastes, you're confident in your choices, and you don't rely on someone else's point of view."




translate eng christie_root_5_after_menu_eec99cb0:
